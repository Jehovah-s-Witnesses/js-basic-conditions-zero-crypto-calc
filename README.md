# js-basic-conditions-zero-crypto-calc

## Needs create simple crypto exchanger.

We need to ask users about the amount of exchange and currency (all available currencies bellow).
After this, ask user about target of exchange (only crypto from an available list)

For example, a user asks 10 Bitcoins to Ethereum. You need a calculated and alert result of operation.

If a user selects not correct currency or non-number value for amount, need alert error (text you need to create)



### Available currencies

| Currency | Price per 1 in USD |
|----------|--------------------|
| Bitcoin  | 66988.57$          |
| Ethereum | 2489.74$           |
| TON      | 4.98$              |
| USDT     | 1$                 |

## Criteria:

- Resolve all errors in the file
- Ensure the code is properly formatted using ESLint (our [pipeline](https://github.com/rammfall-code/guidelines/blob/main/DICTIONARY.md#pipeline-a-pipeline-is-a-sequence-of-automated-steps-that-run-code-checks-it-is-triggered-in-github-after-code-is-pushed-the-pipeline-can-have-three-statuses-pending-checks-are-in-progress-failed-checks-did-not-pass-due-to-issues-like-incorrect-code-errors-or-failed-tests-and-passed-all-checks-were-successful) checks for this).
- The code must comply with the project [guidelines](https://github.com/rammfall-code/guidelines/blob/main/JS.md).
- Pass validation without any errors in [validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
- Additionally, follow all [git guidelines](https://github.com/rammfall-code/guidelines/blob/main/GIT.md) to avoid issues.
